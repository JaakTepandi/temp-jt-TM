# toop-goopra-models

This project contains the Archimate model of the TOOP Reference Architecture (TOOPRA). We are using the [Archi tool](https://www.archimatetool.com/) with the [model repository collaboration plugin](https://www.archimatetool.com/plugins/) for maintaining the TOOPARA Archimate model. 

## Working on the model 
Before you can start working on the module you first need to install Archi and the collaboration plugin. See above links for more information how to install both. 

### Getting the model from the repository 
As a first step you need to get the latest version of the model add this Github repository to your local Archi workspace by selecting _Import Remote Model to Workspace_ from the _Collaboration_ menu. Enter the URL of the repository (https://github.com/TOOP4EU/toop-goopra-models) and you Github account details. After clicking OK the current version of the model should be loaded and you can start making changes.

You only need to perform this step once. Afterwards just select _Refresh model_ from the _Collaboration_ menu to get the latest version of the model from this repository. Please **always refresh the model before you start making changes** to reduce the chances of conflicts with changes made by other team members.

### Saving your changes 
After you have completed your work on the model and want to make it available to the other team members you need to push the changes to the Github repository. To this you first need to commit the changes to your local version of the repository by  selecting _Commit Changes_ from the _Collaboration_ menu. If you didn't already save the changes to the local file system, you will be asked to do so now. When committing the changes please provide a short explanation of the work you did and then click OK. 
Now the changes are ready for publication to the other members of the team, to make them available simply select _Publish Changes_ from the _Collaboration_ menu. NOTE: It can take some time to publish the changes.

### Cancelling your changes 
If you are not happy with the changes you made you can easily roll back to a previous version by either selecting _Abort Uncommitted Changes_.
